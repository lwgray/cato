"""
Test for bundled domain design task display in Cato.

This test verifies that Cato correctly displays bundled design tasks created
by Marcus's advanced PRD parser (GH-108, GH-127).

Bundled design tasks have special characteristics:
- No parent_task_id (they're top-level tasks)
- No children tasks (they're standalone design tasks)
- domain_name field indicates the domain they cover
- feature_ids list shows which features they encompass
- type = "design"

Bug: These tasks are not showing up in Cato's "subtasks" view mode.
