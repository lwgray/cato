"""
Worker JSONL ingestion driver for the Cato cost dashboard.

The Marcus side (``src/cost_tracking/worker_ingester.py``) provides the
:class:`WorkerJSONLIngester` library — it knows how to read a Claude
Code session JSONL file and write ``token_events`` rows. What it doesn't
know is **how to map a session JSONL record to a ``project_id``** —
that's experiment-specific glue. This module supplies that glue.

Binding resolution
------------------
Each Claude Code session record carries a ``cwd`` field — the working
directory of the worker subprocess. Marcus's spawn_agents.py creates a
worktree per agent at::

    <experiment_dir>/worktrees/<agent_id>

…and writes the project's metadata to ``<experiment_dir>/project_info.json``
before spawning workers. The resolver here walks up two levels from
``cwd``, reads ``project_info.json``, and emits an
:class:`AgentBinding`.

Sessions whose cwd doesn't match this layout (project-creator agents,
monitor agents, ad-hoc Claude Code sessions in unrelated dirs) return
``None`` from the resolver and are correctly dropped — they aren't part
of any experiment Cato should attribute cost to.
